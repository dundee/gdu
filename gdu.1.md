# NAME

gdu - Pretty fast disk usage analyzer written in Go

# SYNOPSIS

**gdu \[flags\] \[directory_to_scan\]**

# DESCRIPTION

Pretty fast disk usage analyzer written in Go.

Gdu is intended primarily for SSD disks where it can fully utilize
parallel processing. However HDDs work as well, but the performance gain
is not so huge.
